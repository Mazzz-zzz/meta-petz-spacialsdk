# MetaPetz - Virtual Pet Companion for Meta Quest

A Tamagotchi-inspired mixed reality pet care game built with Meta Spatial SDK for Meta Quest. Take care of your virtual pet by feeding, playing, cleaning, and letting them rest while they float and dance in your real-world environment.

## Features

### 🎮 Gamification & Pet Care
- **Tamagotchi-Style Stats System** - Four dynamic stats that decay over time:
  - Hunger (decreases 5% every 5 seconds)
  - Happiness (decreases 3% every 5 seconds)
  - Health (stays stable unless affected)
  - Energy (decreases 4% every 5 seconds)

- **Interactive Care Actions**:
  - **Feed** - Restores hunger +30%, earns 10 XP
  - **Play** - Increases happiness +30%, uses energy -10%, earns 15 XP
  - **Clean** - Improves health +20%, earns 10 XP
  - **Rest** - Restores energy +40%, earns 5 XP

- **Progression System**:
  - Pet level tracking with XP display
  - Visual progress indicators for XP to next level
  - Color-coded stat bars (Green > Amber > Red)

- **Dynamic Mood System** - Pet mood changes based on overall stats:
  - "Feeling Great! 😊" (>80% stats)
  - "Doing Well 🙂" (60-80%)
  - "Needs Attention 😐" (40-60%)
  - "Not Happy 😟" (20-40%)
  - "Critical! 😢" (<20%)

### 🐾 Pet Selection
Choose from 6 adorable 3D pets:
- **Cat** 🐱 - Curious
- **Dog** 🐶 - Loyal
- **Bunny** 🐰 - Gentle
- **Bird** 🐦 - Energetic
- **Fish** 🐠 - Calm
- **Hamster** 🐹 - Playful

### 🎨 3D Visualization
- Animated 3D pet models that spin and dance
- Glowing pedestal for ambient lighting
- Smooth animations with bouncing and swaying
- Mixed reality passthrough integration

### 📱 Dual Panel Interface
- **Pet Selection Panel** - Scrollable grid of pet cards
- **Pet Info Panel** - Real-time stats, care actions, and pet display

### ☁️ Cloud Save with Firebase
- **Persistent Pet Stats** - Your pet's progress saves automatically to the cloud
- **Cross-Session Persistence** - Stats are restored when you return to the app
- **Auto-Save** - Stats save on every care action and during stat decay
- **Unique User ID** - Each device gets a unique identifier for data isolation

## Building & Running

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Meta Quest device or simulator
- [Meta Spatial Editor](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/spatial-sdk/spatial-editor-overview)

### Build Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Open project in Android Studio
3. Connect Meta Quest device or start simulator
4. Build and run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

### Development
Edit the scene using Meta Spatial Editor:
```
app/scenes/Main.metaspatial
```

### Firebase Setup
The app uses Firebase Realtime Database for cloud persistence. To set up your own Firebase project:

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Create a new project or use existing one

2. **Add Android App**
   - In Project Settings, add an Android app
   - Package name: `com.cybergarden.metapetz`
   - Download `google-services.json` and place in `app/` folder

3. **Enable Realtime Database**
   - Go to Build → Realtime Database
   - Create database (choose your region)
   - Set rules for development:
     ```json
     {
       "rules": {
         ".read": true,
         ".write": true
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Update Database URL** (if using non-US region)
   - In `FirebaseManager.kt`, update the database URL:
     ```kotlin
     private val db = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance("https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.REGION.firebasedatabase.app")
     ```

### Firebase Data Structure
```
users/
  {userId}/
    createdAt: timestamp
    lastActive: timestamp
    deviceId: string
    pets/
      {petName}/
        hunger: float
        happiness: float
        health: float
        energy: float
        level: int
        xp: int
        xpToNextLevel: int
        lastUpdated: timestamp
```

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Select a Pet** - Choose from 6 different pets in the options panel
2. **Watch Your Pet** - See your pet appear in 3D with spinning/dancing animations
3. **Monitor Stats** - Keep an eye on the stat bars in the info panel
4. **Take Care** - Use care action buttons to maintain your pet's wellbeing
5. **Level Up** - Earn XP through care actions to increase your pet's level
6. **Switch Pets** - Return to selection and choose a different pet anytime

## Key Implementation Details

### State Management
